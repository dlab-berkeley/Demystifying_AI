This repository contains the materials for D-Lab's Demystifying AI workshop. 

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this workshop.

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide a basic and relatively non-technical introduction to the foundational concepts underlying contemporary AI tools. First, we’ll cover the the fundamentals of **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Neural Networks/Deep Learning**. Then, we’ll examine the capabilities and limitations of contemporary AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, and outline best practices for the use of such tools. 

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand (and be able to describe in simple language) the concepts underlying “AI” and “Generative AI”, including machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks.
- Understand the current capabilities of public-facing Generative AI tools.
- Understand the limitations and ethical considerations associated with the use of Generative AI.

This workshop does not cover the following:

- Prompt engineering. This is covered in [D-LabWorkshopName](URL).
- Applied coding for Machine Learning. This is covered in [Python Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-Fundamentals) and [R Machine Learning with tidymodels](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Machine-Learning).
- Applied coding for Deep Learning. This is covered in [Python Deep Learning](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Deep-Learning) and [R Deep Learning](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Deep-Learning).
